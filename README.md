## Object Detection Android App

This app is build using ML-KIT Mobile SDK which uses Firebase as a backed and supports all the major API provided by google.
MLkit make machine leanrning expertise onto mobile in the most easier manner, its completely optimised for mobile usecase.

#### Key capabilities
Production-ready for common use cases	
ML Kit comes with a set of ready-to-use APIs for common mobile use cases: 
recognizing text, detecting faces, identifying landmarks, scanning barcodes, labeling images, and 
identifying the language of text. Simply pass in data to the ML Kit library and it gives you the information you need.

##### On-device or in the cloud	
ML Kit’s selection of APIs run on-device or in the cloud. 
Our on-device APIs can process your data quickly and work even when there’s no network connection. 
Our cloud-based APIs, on the other hand, leverage the power of Google Cloud's machine learning technology to give you an even higher level of accuracy.

##### Deploy custom models	
If ML Kit's APIs don't cover your use cases, you can always bring your own existing TensorFlow Lite models. 
Just upload your model to Firebase, and we'll take care of hosting and serving it to your app. 
ML Kit acts as an API layer to your custom model, making it simpler to run and use.
